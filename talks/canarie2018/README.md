# Setup for talk at Canarie2018
This is the setup I used for my recent talk in
[Canarie 2018](https://www.canarie.ca/canarie-national-summit/),
in Ottawa, Canada.

I was using an iRig 25 key keyboard that only has a volume knob which I used to
control the improv mode (see `server.py` for details).

## Instructions
1.  Open `server.scd` in [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) and
    run the main group (put mouse in first left parenthesis and hit Ctrl+Enter).
    This program handles the MIDI communication, as well as playing the
    background groove.
2.  Run `python server.py`. This handles the AI part of the system.
3.  Start jamming!

which includes some demo videos in the thread.

Here's a [video](https://twitter.com/pcastr/status/1047265156441333760)
someone caught of this in action. Not the best part of the performance,
but proof that it worked!
